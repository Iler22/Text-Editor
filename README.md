## Description

Text editor is a Progressive Web Application (PWA) that runs in the browser as well as offline. Once the text editor application has been run, JavaScript files will be bundled using webpack. When the webpack plugins have been run then a HTML file will be generated with a service worker and manifest file. A user is able to enter content on the text editor and close the app or browser and this content will be saved to IndexedDb. Once the application is then loaded again the content will be retrieved from IndexedDb. When the service worker is registered, static assets pre cached upon loading along with subsequent pages and static assets will be available.
